# Hough Transform - Line Detection

Python implementation of hough transform for detecting lines in images.    
Explanation of how the hough transform works in my blog post: [Understanding Hough Transform](https://alyssaq.github.io/2014/understanding-hough-transform)

## Usage
```py
python hough_transform.py
```
## Sample
